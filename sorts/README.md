# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a certain order. The way the data is arranged in a certain order is specified by the sorting algorithm. The most typical orders are lexical or numeric. The significance of sorting is that if data is stored in a sorted form, data retrieval can be greatly optimized. Another use of sorting is to present data in a more readable form.
